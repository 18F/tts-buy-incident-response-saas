## Background

TTS has a need for an incident response, notification, and resolution service which can receive alert information from cloud.gov, login.gov, and other projects within TTS. This application should aggregate the information into incidents, and send the appropriate notifications, provide contextual information on these incidents, automatically manage scheduling and escalation, and provide reporting functionality. This functionality is critical to the ability of the various teams to meet their technical mission needs and compliance requirements.

### What we're hoping to end up with

A Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) that will provide full visibility into any potential issues and incidents that may arise within the applications utilizing the SaaS along with notifications that will allow for timely responses.
